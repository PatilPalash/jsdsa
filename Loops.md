# Different Kinds of Loops in JavaScript

JavaScript supports several kinds of loops that allow you to repeatedly run a block of code under certain conditions.

## Types of Loops

* **`for`** ‚Äì Loops through a block of code a specified number of times.
* **`for...in`** ‚Äì Loops through the properties of an object.
* **`for...of`** ‚Äì Loops through the values of an iterable object (like arrays, strings).
* **`while`** ‚Äì Loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
* **`do...while`** ‚Äì Also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true, but runs at least once.

---

## The `for` Loop

The `for` statement creates a loop with **three optional expressions**:

```javascript
for (expression1; expression2; expression3) {
  // Code block to be executed
}
```

### Description of Expressions

* **Expression 1**: Executes once before the loop starts. Used to initialize variables.
* **Expression 2**: Defines the loop condition. If it evaluates to `true`, the loop runs; if `false`, it stops.
* **Expression 3**: Executes after each iteration of the loop. Typically used to update the loop counter.

### Example:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
```

#### Explanation:

* **Expression 1**: `let i = 0;` ‚Äî Initializes the counter.
* **Expression 2**: `i < 5;` ‚Äî Runs the loop as long as `i` is less than 5.
* **Expression 3**: `i++` ‚Äî Increments `i` after each iteration.

---

## Using Expression 1

Expression 1 is used to **initialize** variables, but it is optional.

### Example with initialization outside the loop:

```javascript
let i = 2;
let len = cars.length;
let text = "";

for (; i < len; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
```

### You can initialize multiple variables:

```javascript
for (let i = 0, len = cars.length, text = ""; i < len; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
```

---

## Using Expression 2

Expression 2 defines the **condition** that must be true for the loop to continue.

### Note:

Expression 2 is optional. If you omit it, you **must** include a `break` statement inside the loop to avoid creating an infinite loop.

### Example:

```javascript
let i = 0;

for (;;){
  if (i >= 5) break;
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

---

## Using Expression 3

Expression 3 usually **updates** the loop variable, but it is also optional.

You can increment inside the loop body instead:

```javascript
let i = 0;
let len = cars.length;
let text = "";

for (; i < len;) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
  i++;
}
```

You can use any logic in Expression 3:

```javascript
for (let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

---

## Loop Scope: `var` vs `let`

### Using `var` in a loop:

```javascript
var i = 5;

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // some code
}

console.log(i); // Output: 10
```

* `var` is **function-scoped**, so it reuses the variable outside the loop.

### Using `let` in a loop:

```javascript
let i = 5;

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // some code
}

console.log(i); // Output: 5
```

* `let` is **block-scoped**, so the loop's `i` is separate from the outer `i`.

## üîÅ JavaScript Looping: `for...in` and `forEach()`

### üß± `for...in` Loop

The `for...in` loop iterates over the **enumerable properties** of an object.

#### Syntax:

```javascript
for (let key in object) {
  // Code block to be executed
}
```

#### Example:

```javascript
const person = {
  fname: "John",
  lname: "Doe",
  age: 25
};

let text = "";
for (let key in person) {
  text += person[key];  // Accessing the value using the key
}
console.log(text);  // Output: "JohnDoe25"
```

### üîÅ `for...in` with Arrays

Although `for...in` can be used with arrays, **it is not recommended when index order matters**, because:

* The order is **not guaranteed**.
* It can iterate over **inherited properties**, not just elements.

#### Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];

let txt = "";
for (let index in numbers) {
  txt += numbers[index];
}
console.log(txt);  // Output: "45491625"
```

> ‚úÖ **Better alternatives** for arrays: `for`, `for...of`, or `forEach()`.

---

## üîÅ `forEach()` Method

The `forEach()` method calls a **callback function** once for each array element, in order.

#### Syntax:

```javascript
array.forEach(function(currentValue, index, array) {
  // Code block
});
```

### Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];

let txt = "";
numbers.forEach(function(value) {
  txt += value;
});
console.log(txt);  // Output: "45491625"
```

> The callback function can take up to three arguments:
>
> * `value` ‚Äì the current element
> * `index` ‚Äì the index of the element
> * `array` ‚Äì the full array

Here is a properly formatted and well-structured explanation of the **`for...of`** loop in JavaScript with examples:

---

## üîÅ JavaScript `for...of` Loop

The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over the **values** of an **iterable** object.
It works with:

* Arrays
* Strings
* Maps
* Sets
* NodeLists
* Other iterable objects

---

### ‚úÖ Syntax:

```javascript
for (variable of iterable) {
  // Code block to be executed
}
```

* **`variable`**: A new variable (declared with `let`, `const`, or `var`) that stores each value from the iterable on every iteration.
* **`iterable`**: An object that implements the iterable protocol (like arrays or strings).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: `for...of` is **not supported in Internet Explorer**.

---

### üîÑ Looping Over an Array

```javascript
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let car of cars) {
  text += car;
}
console.log(text);  // Output: "BMWVolvoMini"
```

---

### üîÑ Looping Over a String

```javascript
let language = "JavaScript";

let text = "";
for (let char of language) {
  text += char;
}
console.log(text);  // Output: "JavaScript"
```

---

### ‚úÖ Key Advantages of `for...of`

* Simpler and more readable than traditional `for` or `for...in` when working with iterable values
* Preserves **order** in arrays and strings
* Does **not** access object keys (unlike `for...in`)

Would you like a comparison chart between `for`, `for...in`, and `for...of` loops?



The `for` loop in C-like languages (like C, C++, Java, JavaScript) works as a control flow statement that allows you to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. Let's break down the structure of the `for` loop you provided and explain how it works from the inside:

```c
for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    // Code block
}
```

### The structure of the `for` loop:
1. **Initialization** (`i = 1`): 
   - This part is executed **only once** before the loop starts. It initializes the loop control variable, which in this case is `i`. It sets the value of `i` to 1.
   - This is the starting point of the loop.

2. **Condition** (`i <= 10`): 
   - This condition is checked **before** each iteration (every time the loop tries to run the code inside the block).
   - If this condition is `true`, the loop will continue to execute. If it is `false`, the loop will stop and exit.
   - In this case, the loop will continue running as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.

3. **Increment** (`i++`): 
   - After each iteration of the loop, this part is executed **after** the block of code inside the loop.
   - `i++` increases the value of `i` by 1 (equivalent to `i = i + 1`).
   - So, after the first loop iteration, `i` becomes 2, after the second iteration it becomes 3, and so on.

### The flow:
- **First iteration**: 
   - `i = 1` (initialization). 
   - The condition `i <= 10` is checked, and since `i` is 1, it passes (i.e., `true`).
   - The code inside the loop is executed (whatever you put inside the `{ }`).
   - After the loop block is executed, `i++` is triggered, so `i` becomes 2.

- **Subsequent iterations**:
   - The condition `i <= 10` is checked each time (i.e., `i` becomes 2, 3, 4, ..., 10).
   - The loop continues to run as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.
   - Each time, `i` is incremented by 1.

- **Final iteration**:
   - When `i` becomes 11, the condition `i <= 10` will be `false`.
   - The loop will stop, and no more iterations will occur.

### Example:

Let's say you want to print the value of `i` on each iteration of the loop:

```c
for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

### Summary:
- The loop starts with `i = 1`.
- It checks if `i <= 10`. If true, it runs the loop block.
- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i++`).
- When `i` becomes 11, the condition `i <= 10` fails, and the loop stops.
