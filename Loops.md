The `for` loop in C-like languages (like C, C++, Java, JavaScript) works as a control flow statement that allows you to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. Let's break down the structure of the `for` loop you provided and explain how it works from the inside:

```c
for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    // Code block
}
```

### The structure of the `for` loop:
1. **Initialization** (`i = 1`): 
   - This part is executed **only once** before the loop starts. It initializes the loop control variable, which in this case is `i`. It sets the value of `i` to 1.
   - This is the starting point of the loop.

2. **Condition** (`i <= 10`): 
   - This condition is checked **before** each iteration (every time the loop tries to run the code inside the block).
   - If this condition is `true`, the loop will continue to execute. If it is `false`, the loop will stop and exit.
   - In this case, the loop will continue running as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.

3. **Increment** (`i++`): 
   - After each iteration of the loop, this part is executed **after** the block of code inside the loop.
   - `i++` increases the value of `i` by 1 (equivalent to `i = i + 1`).
   - So, after the first loop iteration, `i` becomes 2, after the second iteration it becomes 3, and so on.

### The flow:
- **First iteration**: 
   - `i = 1` (initialization). 
   - The condition `i <= 10` is checked, and since `i` is 1, it passes (i.e., `true`).
   - The code inside the loop is executed (whatever you put inside the `{ }`).
   - After the loop block is executed, `i++` is triggered, so `i` becomes 2.

- **Subsequent iterations**:
   - The condition `i <= 10` is checked each time (i.e., `i` becomes 2, 3, 4, ..., 10).
   - The loop continues to run as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.
   - Each time, `i` is incremented by 1.

- **Final iteration**:
   - When `i` becomes 11, the condition `i <= 10` will be `false`.
   - The loop will stop, and no more iterations will occur.

### Example:

Let's say you want to print the value of `i` on each iteration of the loop:

```c
for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

### Summary:
- The loop starts with `i = 1`.
- It checks if `i <= 10`. If true, it runs the loop block.
- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i++`).
- When `i` becomes 11, the condition `i <= 10` fails, and the loop stops.

I hope that helps clarify how the `for` loop works from the inside! Let me know if you'd like further details on how this works or specific examples.
